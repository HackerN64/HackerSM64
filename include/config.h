// Skybox size modifier, changing this will add support for larger skybox images. NOTE: Vanilla skyboxes may break if you change this option. Be sure to rescale them accordingly.
// Whenever you change this, make sure to run "make -C tools clean" to rebuild the skybox tool (alternatively go into skyconv.c and change the file in any way (like adding/deleting a space) to specifically rebuild that tool).
