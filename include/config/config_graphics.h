// Spawn floombas in the title screen

// Enable widescreen (16:9) support
#define WIDE

// Skybox size modifier, changing this will add support for larger skybox images. NOTE: Vanilla skyboxes may break if you change this option. Be sure to rescale them accordingly.
// Whenever you change this, make sure to run "make -C tools clean" to rebuild the skybox tool (alternatively go into skyconv.c and change the file in any way (like adding/deleting a space) to specifically rebuild that tool).
// When increasing this, you should probably also increase the GFX pool size. (the GFX_POOL_SIZE define above)
#define SKYBOX_SIZE 1

// When this option is enabled, LODs will ONLY work on console.
// When this option is disabled, LODs will work regardless of whether console or emulator is used.
// Regardless of whether this setting is enabled or not, you can use gIsConsole to wrap your own code in a console check.
#define AUTO_LOD

// Include Puppyprint, a display library for text and large images.
// Automatically included when PUPPYPRINT_DEBUG is enabled
// #define PUPPYPRINT

// Disable AA (Improves console performance but causes visible seams between unconnected geometry).
// #define DISABLE_AA

// Makes the coins ia8 64x64 instead of ia16 32x32. Uses new ia8 textures so that vanilla coins look better.
#define IA8_COINS

// Similar to the above, but 30 FPS (Textures by InTheBeef, cleaned up by Arceveti)
#define IA8_30FPS_COINS

// Use .rej microcode for certain objects (experimental - only should be used when F3DZEX_GBI_2 is defined).
// For advanced users only. Does not work perfectly out the box, best used when exported actor models are
// using 64 vertex sizes, offered by Fast64 in the microcode menu.
// #define OBJECTS_REJ

/**
 * Mario's silhouette when behind solid objects/surfaces
 * Also enables new render layers, such as LAYER_ALPHA_DECAL.
 * The number is the intensity of the silhouette, from 0-255.
 * NOTE: The overlap between Mario's model parts is visible on certain HLE plugins.
 * Also, this also disables anti-aliasing on Mario.
 * NOTE: Regarding performance, silhouette seems to lose 1-2 frames on console.

// Disable the fix to Koopa's unshelled model.

// Lightweight directional lighting engine by Fazana. Intended for giving proximity and positional pointlights to small objects.

// Uses the correct "up" vector for the guLookAtReflect call in geo_process_master_list_sub.
// It is sideways in vanilla, and since vanilla's environment map textures are sideways too, they will appear as sideways in-game if this is enabled.
// Make sure your custom environment map textures are the correct orientation.

// Disables object shadows. You'll probably only want this either as a last resort for performance or if you're making a super stylized hack.
// #define DISABLE_SHADOWS

// Use old shadow IDs for Fast64 compatibility. This is a temporary fix until Fast64 is updated to use the enum defines.
// NOTE: When this is enabled, The 49th hardcoded rectangle shadow will act as a regular circular shadow, due to Mario's shadow ID being 99 in vanilla.
