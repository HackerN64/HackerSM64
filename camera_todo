split into:
-camera (the bare minimum to operate the SM64 camera)
  - all the default camera input modes
  - The camera triggers and zoomout masks as to not interfere with fast64
-camera_cutscene (All cutscene/spline processing)
-camera_level (level-specific processing code)
  - (maybe do this per level?)
-camera_math
  - all math and spline routines
-camera_sound (maybe)
  - all sound routines
-camera_geo (maybe)
  - FOV and stuff


- sModeTransitions has functions that can be consolidated to a stub func
